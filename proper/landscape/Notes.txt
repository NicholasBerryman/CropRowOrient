Todo:
    Fix horizontal vs vertical issues (e.g. double check the row/column counting for approximate canditate line)
        Also just generally copy everything over to portrait section
    Optimise all
        Especially SteepGradient pixel iteration
    Test out contour centre vs all pixels in windowRegression
    Properly utilise horizontal search space in horizontal strips method
    
    Make sure to mention Hough Transform inapplicability
    
    Clean up all code
